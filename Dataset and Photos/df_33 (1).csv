The first room they gave us was dirty... bed unmade, trash everywhere, etc. We went to the front desk and the lady working was very sorry and very nice, but didn't seem to know where to put us. We are smokers and wanted a smoking room. They didn't have any smoking rooms left, but the owner handed us an ashtray and said...view more it's a smoking room now. I wouldn't mind smoking outside if they didn't have any smoking rooms left, but when I got to the room, I understood why he didn't mind giving us the ashtray. The carpet was atrocious and when I went to take a shower, the handle to turn the water on came off in my hand. The tiles were missing all over the bathroom, the toilet looked like it hadn't been cleaned in years. They advertise coffee makers and alarm clocks. Not only did we not have either, there was no remote to the TV either. The smell in the room made me think they had just removed a corpse or something as equally bad. They make you pay in advance and there is no refund, now I know why. They advertise that they have the largest indoor pool in Iowa, however it has been closed for years for improvements.

I lodged a complaint about broken furniture that might have caused me an injury. The owner implied that perhaps I broke the furniture. It was a sofa bed in the front room of the suite. I was charged 120.00 for the suite. When I checked in, I was told there was wet bar. When I got in the room, there was nothing, but an empty refrigerator and cabinets, which is not the definition of a hotel wet bar. When I sat on the bed, ...view morethe frame broke. When I tried to get out, it broke again. My roommate had to come and help me get out of thebed. Then the bed could not be put back in the couch. I have had a hip replacement. Sitting on that sofa bed with a broken frame that fell in could have caused damage to my hip. And, that was not all the curtains in the room were too short to cover the entire window so there was light in the room all night. The last straw was that the room had a hair dryer that would not stay on while in use. I had to hold the on button to use the dryer, which made it totally useless. Our stay was not a good experience. I have stayed in Best Western Hotels all over the US and never used one with this many problems. When I asked for a reduction in my charge, I was given only a 20, instead of a no charge for the room. I would not have been so disgruntled had the owner, Sarah Patel, given me a free night, but she did not. The hotel furniture was dangerous, did not have the wet bar that it promised, and did not have appropriate window coverings. Sarah Patel, owner of the establishment, provided (1) poor services, (2) unsafe equipment and (3) inoperable appliances.

The bus was small and very comfortable, reclining seats, air conditioning, lots of leg room and space for day packs. Anything bigger just couldn't get to the places we visited; along tiny, twisting Irish back roads (So glad I didn't drive). The guide/driver was a fountain of knowledge, treating everyone as his new best friend. Stories and info flowed easily and I never felt like I was receiving a lecture. We could stop anytime we wanted for a photo and we had plenty of time at sites; we just all sauntered back to the bus when we were ready.

From the relatively tranquil settings of the hotel pools you can pop through an exclusive turnstile straight into Meditterania and enjoy all the fun of what has to be the best theme park outside of Florida. The hotel is immaculately kept with the quaint look of a Mediterranean village and offers acres of outdoor space to stretch out and soak up the sun although, like most hotels it fails to provide enough shade and parasols are scarce. The rooms have recently been renovated and there's free Wi-Fi in all areas (as at July 2014). In the neighbouring theme park there's an amazing variety of rides and shows to suit everyone. The main gripe is the lack of decent food in any of the restaurants. With the exception of Rac de Mar near the entrance we experienced cold, bland and overpriced dishes at all of the restaurants in addition to poor service. At The Iron Horse Hotel and the Steak House we could not distinguish between any of the meats served. Most of it tasted like I cooked it - which isn't great! For those staying at the hotel I would suggest you take advantage of the ample breakfast and eat out at nearby Salou for half the price and twice the choice.

Sutton Bay is a Beautiful resort and we have found it to be extremely family friendly, clean and affordable. Management is always helpful and our experience has been that there is NO tolerance for underage drinking or out of control drinking of any kind for that matter. Managements goal is clearly to provide a fun, safe and clean atmosphere for families to spend the day, week or even summer camping, fishing, swimming or hiking. They (management) have devoted their life to this cause and this is clearly evident. We look forward to many more memories at Sutton Bay and it is our opinion that any negative postings came to be as a form of retaliation from a person or persons that either had trouble following the simple rules or were refused service for a valid reason, almost always for the protection or consideration of the other guests.

We had not been to Sicily before and this was an excellent base for exploring several parts of the island - including some beautiful sites, all the more so for being decked in spring flowers. The Greek temples at Selinunte and Segesta were especially impressive as were the Roman mosaics at Piazza Armerina, although it was almost 3 hours drive over the mountains in the centre of the island to the latter. We also very much enjoyed the food - the seafood was excellent (even if ultimately disappointing in Porticello, where much is landed from the boats). There are several good restaurants near the hotel including La Brasiera and (more expensively) La Caseta de la Nonna. In short, we can't wait to return to Sicily and visit some other areas. The hotel very much suited our needs, and as part of a package deal (with flights and hire car) was very good value. Driving around Palermo is quite challenging and we advise full insurance cover as it is rare to see a car without scratches down the side. Top tip: make sure you have a map to the hotel from the airport or a sat nav as without this (as we discovered in a torrential rain storm) it is very hard to find your way around the outskirts of Palermo with its many one-way streets. The hotel has secure parking (at an extra cost) and rooms have air conditioning or heating. Careful if you leave your windows open as there are Mosquitos (in the spring at least).",01.png,akusara-jungle-resort-and-spa.png,Kamar-Hotel-Terbaik-2019-Ada-dari-Indonesia.png,photo_34153577.png

The hotel is across the Lake from Bellagio which is a short boat ride away and there are restaurants and pizzerias within a short walk of the hotel in either direction. Also the hotel is directly next door to the Villa Carlotta (a stately house and botanical gardens, well worth a visit). However the Hotel decor has not changed at all since our last visit 8 years ago, and it is showing. The rooms were sparsely decorated, the shower leaked everywhere and the TV was the oldest, grainiest model I've seen in years. The breakfast restaurant commanded beautiful views of the lake but the food was seriously lacking in quality. The bacon was greasy and the sausages looked ominous. They had prossecco available to drink though and had a wonderful tasting coffee and hot chocolate machine. The waiters were all dressed in fine uniforms that although smart looked as though they were designed in the 40's. The whole hotel needs a kick into the modern day. But all in all, we had a wonderful stay and we would recommend this hotel to everyone we meet. If you stay here, you will have a good time on the lake, but don't expect modern luxuries.",fachada.png,772cc72f9d0169bf8e9f619dd47097bb.png,Aplikasi Pemesanan Kamar Hotel Antisipasi Kenaikan Permintaan Libur Lebaran.png,Kamar Mandi Mewah.png

It was close to Universal Studios. When we first got to the room there was no hot water. They did fix it however. There is also a weird musty smell in the room and throughout the hotel. Even with opening the sliding glass door it did not go away. It's probably because the hotel is so old and there is no exhaust fans in the bathrooms so the steam really gets going in be rooms. The walls and ceilings are paper thin so you can hear every door closing and everything that goes on around you. The hotel has been updated so don't let the hotel so old statement rub you the wrong way. The pool area and hot tub is extremely nice and well kept and the bar and bartender at the pool is a highlight of the property. One last issue is that you have to pay for parking with a hotel stay....ridiculous in my book!
